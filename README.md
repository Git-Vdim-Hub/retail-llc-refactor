# retail-llc-refactor

## Description
- Updating Horiseon website because it did not follow accessibility standards for search engines, used non-sematic HTML elements, did not use logical structure elements independent of styling and positions and the icon and image elements did not have alt attributes. Additionally, the heading attributes were not in sequential order with no concise and/or descriptive title. Finally, it had a broken link, no developer comments in the code.
- By correcting these issues the website is more semantically correct and meets accessibility standards.
- During this process I learned about html and css semantics and structure. Additionally how to provide proper code comments, css organization and github usage.

## Installation

All code was written in VS Code and deployed using gitbash/github. No additional plugins were required to deploy this code.
